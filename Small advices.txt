Small advices:

For bluegene:
U have 2 directories: ~ aka /home/edu-cmc* and /gpfs/data/edu-cmc*
I don't mean what's the difference, only that gpfs is faster and sometime is cleared.
But i think it's copies. Don't mind about it and copy files on local machine)
U need to connect: ssh edu-cmc-*@bluegene.hpc.cs.msu.ru
If everything is okey with keys/proxies blablabla u'll see a helplist. READ IT!
There's vim and emacs. I hate both and scp is fast. So u can use cat, it shows file to terminal)
Copy u't file via scp: scp "u'rfile" edu-cmc*@bluegene.hpc.cs.msu.ru:~
Now u have file in u'r home(~) diretory on bluegene. 
Then u need a compile u'r cpp file: mpixlcxx_r -qsmp=omp skipod.cpp -o ski
http://hpc.cs.msu.ru/bgp/development/compilers - about compilers on this wonder
Then u should schedule it: mpisubmit.bg -n 1 -m smp -w 00:05:00 --stdout outfile ski -- u'r args
About options u can read on: http://hpc.cs.msu.ru/bgp/jobs/mpisubmit
There is a LoadLeverer, but there's some missunderstandings about llsubmit, don't mind about it
Check: llq
It's an queue. If there is no u'r job, it's completed) Or u'r fuck upped, u'r dummy and read what was written in terminal!
Also check llq -b u'rtasknumlike11001111
U can see result in outfile)
It's all u need for u'r task)

Extended: read on hpc.cs.msu.ru, it's not so shitty written as manuals on 3'rd mashgraph)))
